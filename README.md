# Investigating the Richness and Diversity of Chaetognatha Across Different Latitudes: A Comparative Study of Canada, the United States, and India

Chaetognatha, commonly known as arrow worms, are widely found in marine environments and serve as a key food source for various fish species, including mackerel and sardines, as well as other predators of copepods. These organisms exhibit significant morphological variation and their species diversity and reproductive timing are affected by various ecological factors such as temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. A DNA barcoding study conducted along the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans aimed to discriminate the genetic variation among Chaetognatha species (Jennings et al., 2010). The study found minimal geographic association with the barcodes used, suggesting further investigation into how geographic variables, particularly latitude, influence species richness and distribution of Chaetognatha. The current study explores the richness and diversity of Chaetognatha across Canada, the USA, and India using data from the Barcoding of Life Database (BOLD). The dataset includes 80 variables and 1891 observations across 34 regions and 35 countries, encompassing 115 unique species, seven families, and 225 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). The analysis focuses on the distribution of BINs, records, and species by country, and examines the relationship between latitude and species richness.

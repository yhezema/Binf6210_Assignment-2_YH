# Phylogenetic Analysis of the Cecidomyiidae Family: Comparing Mitochondrial COI and Nuclear CAD Genes 

The family Cecidomyiidae, commonly known as gall midges, comprises a highly diverse group within the order Diptera with 6 subfamilies. These small flies are known for their ability to induce galls on plants, a trait that has significant ecological and economic implications due to the role of galls in plant-pest dynamics and ecosystem functioning (Devika et al., 2017). Phylogenetic analysis, using molecular markers, offers a valuable approach to uncovering these relationships and understanding the evolutionary history of gall midges. Dorchin et al., 2019 constructed a combined phylogenetic tree using five mitochondrial and nuclear genes to conclude the comprehensive phylogeny for the most species-rich and ecologically diverse subfamily of gall midges. However, limited studies investigated whether the mitochondrial and nuclear genes yield the same phylogenetic. 

In this study, we focus on two genetic markers to construct phylogenetic trees for selected Cecidomyiidae species: the mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene and the nuclear Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CAD) gene. By comparing the phylogenetic trees derived from COI and CAD, we aim to assess the extent of congruence between these two markers and investigate how they may capture different aspects of evolutionary history within gall midges. We hypothesize that the phylogenetic trees constructed from COI and CAD sequences will show some level of topological congruence, suggesting similar evolutionary patterns for the studied species. This comparative approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of gall midge evolution and highlight the value of using multiple molecular markers in phylogenetic studies.
